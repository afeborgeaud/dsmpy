This directory contains the following datafiles and scripts:

2d_convert_binary_to_ascii.m : This MATLAB file (which also works in Octave)
converts perplex binary datafiles (as provided from Nakagawa / Tackley / StagYY)
into ASCII files. One output ASCII file contains model properties along a
single vertical profile.

Users should change the first three lines of the file, which give the directory,
root name and horizontal points for which output files should be created.

add_attenuation.py :
This file takes the output from the previous script and computes the anelastic
properties (V_S, V_S, Q_S, Q_K, Q_P) according to an anelasticity model from
Goes and coworkers.

Goes_attenuation_models.py : File containing functions and other objects used
by add_attenuation.py.

prem.txt : PREM data file for depth -> pressure conversion.
